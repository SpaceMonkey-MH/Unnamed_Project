## General ideas:
	- I think we need 10 levels:
		- One test level with just dummies. or maybe the testing should be done at the end of each level? Nah.
			Maybe a few easy enemies at the beginning to warm up.
		- 8 weapon levels, one for each weapon appart from the first melee one. Each on serves as a tutorial for the
			weapon. The 7 last levels are locked until the first one is complete (the first one is a general purpose
			tutorial). Each level ends on a boss fight. Killing the boss ends the level and unlocks the weapon.
		- One final level with a big boss at the end, unlocked only when all the other levels (except the test
			one of course) are complete.
	- As of 2024/08/10: There are 10 and a half (the Throw) weapons in total. Or let's say 11. Or 10.
		We need one level for each of that, plus one test level, plus the final level, plus the endless attacks
		level:
		- When we play a new level, we are temporarily given a weapon, that we unlock when we complete the level.
		- At the end of each level (except the test one) is a boss, when the boss dies the level ends and the
			player unlocks the weapon of the level.
		- At the beginning of the game/on a new save, the player has 0 weapon, and only one level unlocked/that
			can be played, the tutorial level.
			-> At the start of the tutorial level, the player is given temporary access to the Melee Weapon, and maybe
				to the Throw, Idk yet.
			-> The level is easy, short, and meant to teach the player the basis of the gameplay.
			-> At the end of the tutorial level is a small boss, easily vanquished, and we the boss falls the level
				ends.
			-> After completing the tutorial level, the player unlocks the Melee Weapon, as well as all the other
				levels except the final one.
		- After the first level, the player can access the test level, and can play the "normal" levels in any order
			they please.
			-> At the beginning of each normal level, the player is granted temporary access to the weapon of the
				level, then they get to try it on a few dummies, then the level starts.
			-> The level is of a normal length and difficulty, and is made to showcase the capabilities of the
				weapon of the level, for instance, the Railgun level would have enemies lined up, but would still
				be possible to do with other weapons. Also the level should be themed with the weapon.
			-> At the end of the level is a boss, relatively hard, designed with the weapon in mind. Killing it
				ends the level, and grants the player permanent access to the level weapon.
		- The test level allows the player to try any weapon they have unlocked on dummies, for any amount of time.
		- When the player has completed all the normal levels and unlocked all the weapons, they unlock the final
			level.
			-> The final level start rather hard, and is relatively long and hard.
			-> The final level uses all the mechanics from the normal levels, and combines them.
			-> The final level ends with a big boss, hard to beat. Killing it shows credits and unlocks the endless
				attacks level.
		- After killing the final boss, the player can access the endless attacks level, where they face endless waves
			of enemies, of increasing strength, with a score based on killed enemies and combos and shit.
