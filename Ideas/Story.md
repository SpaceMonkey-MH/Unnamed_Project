# General ideas:
	The game could be about a recurring character that we follow through various adventures in different games,
	kind of like creating a franchise. I don't think this character can be Gogol, as he is kind of limited,
	but maybe they could be related? I'm thinking maybe they are linked somehow, and they live various
	adventures separated or together, in a crossover of some sort.
	I think that for this game, the story should be short, as it is an action game, not a place where people
	actually want to read. Also, I think it is too early for Witness Me Studio to deal with complex stories.
	The main character could be called "Cuby", undefined gender for now. I need to find a personnality for them.
	They could be 
	I don't know what to do. Cuby is currently a white cube, but he should be red and black. Or should he?
	I can't do an origin story for Cuby on the first game of the series, that wouldn't make any sense.
	What if Cuby was white all along? He does not need to be of any other color, which is fine, because it
	is already their color and I can't be bothered to change it. We could follow them on their adventures,
	starting from some point, and then later making the origin story, or not.
	I need to find a way to connect the plot to the fact that Cuby has weapons and whatnot. Let's say Cuby is a he.
	What we're going with is that he has the weapons on him all along, he just lacks the ammunitions to supply them.
	The issue I have, is that my idea would be better suited for a sequel or a prequel than for an opening title
	or a standalone.

# Story for the game:
## Version 1:
	Cuby goes to live in a new neighborhood, which seems plaisant at first, but then reveals to be. Nah.
## Version 2 (Cuby's origin story):
	Nah. Not yet.
## Version 3:
	The bad guys are somewhat racist or intolerant. Cuby then goes on a rampaging vengeance, killing them all.
	He is helped in his quest by O-Ren, a friendly doggo, who digs out ammunitions in exchange for treats and
	other good things for dogs, which are obtained by finishing a level.
## Version 4:
	Same as version 3, but instead of being racist, the bad guys are polluting and destroying
	what O-Ren likes, so we go through fire and blood to retrieve it. It can be things like cattle that
	produces cheese, woods that bring sticks, nice spots for naps, routes for walks, the ability to watch
	over horses (somehow, idk yet), nice people, etc.
	So, basically, Cuby was chilling somewhere, and then O-Ren arrived all panicked, telling him that the bad
	guys had taken over the world, en-work-slaved the people, destroyed the forests, put the cattle in industrial
	farms, polluted the nap spots and the walk routes, did something with the horses.
	Wait, maybe that's too ambitious, idk.
## Version 5:
	Cuby is chilling, chopping wood with his big axe. O-Ren arrives, saying "Oi, the bad guys are here, they've taken control of my the good stuff, come help me bro!", to which Cuby replies "I'm on it, don't worry fam.". He then gets angry, grabs his weapons, remembers that he buried the ammunitions because he is retired, he only has a clip or whatever, so he asks O-Ren to dig them up, while he goes whop some ass, and retrieve nice stuff for her. Each level, he gains temporary access to a weapon, and when he finishes the level he gets a stick or whatever, and when he goes back, O-Ren has dug up the ammo for the weapon, which he unlocks, bis repetitam. Until the final boss, which holds the best thing of all (Idk what it is yet), and when he gets it she is super happy! Then he can just destroy endless waves of enemies for fun, and out of anger.
