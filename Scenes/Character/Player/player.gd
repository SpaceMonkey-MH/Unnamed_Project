## Defining variables:
# Speed on the movement of the player, in pixels/second.
@export var player_move_speed: float = 300.0
# Maximum number of air jumps.
@export var air_jumps_max: int = 3
# Counter of the air jumps done, initialized at air_jumps_max.
var air_jumps_current: int = air_jumps_max

## Base variables, not used directly for the jump.
# Height of the jump, in pixels.
@export var jump_height: float = 120.0
# Time for the player to reach the peak of the jump, in seconds.
@export var jump_time_to_peak: float = 0.5
# Time to reach the ground during the jump, in seconds.
@export var jump_time_to_descent: float = 0.4

## Variables directly used for the jump and the falling:
# Velocity applied to the player when jumping.
@onready var jump_velocity: float = ((2.0 * jump_height) / jump_time_to_peak) * -1.0
# Gravity applied to the player during the rising part of the jump.
@onready var jump_gravity: float = ((-2.0 * jump_height) /
									(jump_time_to_peak * jump_time_to_peak)) * -1.0
# Gravity applied to the plyaer during the fall.
@onready var fall_gravity: float = ((-2.0 * jump_height) /
									(jump_time_to_descent * jump_time_to_descent)) * -1.0

# CharacterMovementStateMachine as a variable, so that check_if_can_move() can be used.
@onready var movement_state_machine: CharacterMovementStateMachine = $CharacterMovementStateMachine
# BodyAnimationTree as a variable so it can be activated.
@export var body_animation_tree: AnimationTree 
# WeaponsAnimationTree as a variable so it can be activated.
@export var weapons_animation_tree: AnimationTree 
# BodySprite2D as a variable so it can be flipped and modulated.
@export var body_sprite_2d: Sprite2D
# WeaponsSprite2D as a variable so it can be flipped and rotated.
@export var weapons_sprite_2d: Sprite2D
# FireSpitterWeapon as a variable so it can be rotated.
@export var fire_spitter_area_2D: Area2D
# FireSpitter sprite (for now, a color rect) as a variable so it can be flipped.
@export var fire_spitter_sprite_2d: Sprite2D
# SoundBlasterArea as a variable so it can be rotated.
@export var sound_blaster_area: Area2D
# SoundBlaster sprite (for now, a color rect) as a variable so it can be flipped.
@export var sound_blaster_sprite: Sprite2D
# Whether or not the player can damage themselves. Used (for now) in the bullet_3 script for the AoE.
# Should ultimately be likend to options. Might have to move it, Idk.

# Flashing is when the player takes damage.

# I think it is useless for now.
@export var notifier: VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D
# Whether or not the special sounds should be played. Should ultimately be set in options.
# For some reason, it isn't correctly exported in the editor. So I need to do it here to debug. Sadge.
@export var special_sounds: bool = false
# Whether or not the game should go crazy, like drunk projectiles and things like that.

# Variable used to smooth the rotation of weapons_sprite_2d in the _process(delta) function.
